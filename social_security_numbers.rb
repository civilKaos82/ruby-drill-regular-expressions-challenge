# Hey! You'll probably want to look at the tests in `social_security_numbers_spec.rb`
# to see examples of what your code should and shouldn't do

# Determine whether a string contains a Social Security number.
def has_ssn?(string)
end

# Return the Social Security number from a string.
def grab_ssn(string)
end

# Return all of the Social Security numbers from a string.
def grab_all_ssns(string)
end

# Obfuscate all of the Social Security numbers in a string. Example: XXX-XX-4430.
def hide_all_ssns(string)
end

# Ensure all of the Social Security numbers use dashes for delimiters.
# Example: 480.01.4430 and 480014430 would both be 480-01-4430.
