# Ruby Drill Regular Expressions

##Learning Competencies

* Use Regular Expressions
* Use Ruby Docs to effectively research existing Ruby methods
* Work with Standard Ruby Classes

##Summary

 Ruby's `String` class has over [100 public methods](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/String.html) that give Ruby programmers a remarkable power to process, manipulate, and transform textual data. About a dozen of those `String` methods use Regular Expressions in order to allow for high-powered string matching.

An example of low-powered string matching is when you use your browser's search (âŒ˜f on a Mac) for a specific word, say, your own name. What if you wanted to search your browser for anything that matches the pattern for a social security number? For that, you'd use Regular Expressions.

As you work through the exercises of this challenge, we recommend you use [http://rubular.com](http://rubular.com) to help you code your regex.  Refer to the [Pickaxe Guide](http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/html/language.html#UJ) or this [overview](http://www.bluebox.net/about/blog/2013/02/using-regular-expressions-in-ruby-part-1-of-3/) if you get stuck!

##Releases

###Release 0

* Use the tests in `source/regular_expressions_spec.rb` to guide you to a solution
* Add additional tests to make you feel more comfortable with your implementation. For instance, what happens when you pass a string with only a single SSN into the `hide_all_ssns` or `get_all_ssns`  methods?
* Did adding tests help you solve the challenge more effectively? How? Add and commit a file called `tests.md` with your thoughts.
